{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Data Flow for Apache Mesos is a cloud-native orchestration service for composable 
data microservices on [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/). With Spring Cloud Data Flow, 
developers can create and orchestrate data pipelines for common use cases such as data ingest, real-time analytics, and data import/export.

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Cloud Data Flow for Apache Mesos offers a collection of patterns and best practices for data 
microservices running as streaming and batch data pipelines in Apache Mesos.

This project was originally maintained by the Spring Cloud Data Flow Team at [Pivotal Software](https://www.pivotal.io), however further maintainance was donated to [TrustedChoice.com](https://www.trustedchoice.com) as explained [here](https://spring.io/blog/2018/11/01/project-update-spring-cloud-data-flow-for-apache-mesos-and-apache-yarn).

For legacy information, refer to the [original project page](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-mesos/).

## Features

* Consume streaming and batch data microservices as maven artifacts
* Create, unit-test, troubleshoot and manage data microservices in isolation
* Develop using: DSL, Shell, REST-APIs, Dashboard, and Flo
* Take advantage of Apache Mesos value-adds such as metrics, security, logging, health checks, and remote management at each data microservice level
* Scale stream and batch pipelines through `Marathon APIs` or `Marathon UI` 
* Deploy task and batch jobs through `Chronos APIs` or `Chronos UI`

## Quick Start

Step 1 - [Configure, Deploy and Download](http://trustedchoice.github.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-mesos/docs/1.7.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#_deploying_streams_and_tasks_on_apache_mesos_and_marathon_chronos) a Mesos cluster, Spring Cloud Data Flow for Apache Mesos Server and the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell Application

Step 2 - Create `ticktock` Stream
```
dataflow:>stream create --name ticktock --definition "time | log" --deploy
```

Step 3 - Verify `ticktock` Results in Mesos UI

Step 4 - Launch Dashboard at: http://&lt;SCDF_SERVER_HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/dashboard
